    <div class="excerpt">
        Hi, I am Ananth, a professional web developer by day and an amateur game developer by night. I was born on 14th October 1991 in a small town Manipal, along the western coast of India. Situated on top of a hill, the town is 20 km away from beach and 100 km away from the western ghats. At the moment I work as a Full Stack Engineer at a Sports Media Company called Sportskeeda. You can check out our website <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com" target="_blank">here</a>. In my free time I love playing games on my PS4 and working out. Some of my all time favorite titles include Rayman Legends, Crash Bandicoot Trilogy and Borderlands. Fitness has been a major influence in my life since 2013, and am an amateur crossfitter since 2017.
