            <p>My name is Michael Dwan. I'm a software designer and engineer living in Boulder Colorado. I build things I find useful. Usually for consumers. Almost always for humans.</p>
            <p>Most recently I worked as a product manager at Dropbox in San Francisco. Before Dropbox, I co-founded Snapjoy, the world's first auto-organizing online photo library. Snapjoy was part of Y Combinator's summer 2011 batch and acquired by Dropbox in December 2012.</p>
